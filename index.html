<p>A beach is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landform">landform</a> alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)">rock</a>, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology">biological</a> sources, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc_shell">mollusc shell</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coralline_algae">coralline algae</a>. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.</p>
<p>Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines.[2] These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. To support these uses, some beaches have human-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents.</p>

    <p>Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or recreation. Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins. Preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure.</p>
<h2>the parts of a beach</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are several conspicuous parts to a beach that relate to the processes that form and shape it. The part mostly above water (depending upon tide), and more or less actively influenced by the waves at some point in the tide, is termed the beach berm. The berm is the deposit of material comprising the active shoreline. The berm has a crest (top) and a face—the latter being the slope leading down towards the water from the crest. At the very bottom of the face, there may be a trough, and further seaward one or more long shore bars: slightly raised, underwater embankments formed where the waves first start to break.</p>
